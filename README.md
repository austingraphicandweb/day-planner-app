## Usage
<i>In this project I have made a day planner application. This application was made based off of the instructions given to me in the assignment. At the top of the calendar you can see what the date is. As you scroll down you will notice that the blocks are color coded. The grey blocks are hours in the past, the red block is the present hour, and the green blocks are future time within a standard work day. If you click on the text input field you will have the ability to enter in an event you would like to save to that hour time block. If you inspect your page you will see that the event has been saved to local storage after clicking the save icon on the right hand side of the block.<i>
